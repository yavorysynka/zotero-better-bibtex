* Integration with **[Report Customizer](Citation-Keys)**
* Integration with **[Zotfile](Citation-Keys)**

* **[Automated export](Push-and-Pull-Export)** of collections to keep your .bib files all fresh
* Automatic **[journal abbreviation](Citation-Keys)** to bring BibTeX export on par with the Word integration
